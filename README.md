## Technologies used:

-   React as the UI library.

-   Next.js for the as the server.

-   Prisma as the ORM.

-   NextAuth as the authentication backend with passwordless logins and OAuth.

## To run:

-   Clone and cd into the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/k4u5h4L/movies-n-stuff.git && cd movies-n-stuff
```

-   Install the dependencies

```
yarn install
```

-   Create a new file called `.env` and fill in variables and keys from different providers.

-   Run migrations for the DB (if not present).

```
npx prisma migrate dev --preview-feature
npx prisma generate
```

-   Create a folder called `thumbnails/` in the `public/` directory. Add the thumbnails you want to display on those movies. Name them serially as `pic-1.jpg`, `pic-2.jpg`, etc. Stick to `.jpg` format.

-   Create a folder called `media/` in the root directory. Here, add the videos/movies you want to be streamed to the client. Name them serially as `video-1.mp4`, `video-2.mp4`, etc. Stick to `.mp4` format.

-   Now with all the API keys and media loaded, run development server.

```
yarn dev
```

-   Now visit the location [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to check out the site!
